# OVERRIDDEN BY ONEARLY
# ===============================

# This workflow has been overridden at OnEarly to avoid automatic Upptime template updates
# and to support GitHub App authentication instead of Personal Access Tokens.
# 
# Original Upptime template updates are disabled for controlled updates and better security.
